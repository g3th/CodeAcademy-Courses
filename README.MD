## Code Problems Used to Complete Codebase/Hyperskill Courses

## Kotlin

### Chimps (CodeAcademy)

Problem to understand Kotlin collections like lists, sets and maps.

Will take user input and use various methods to change/delete/insert values into various types of containers.

### squareAnTriangle (CodeAcademy)

Understanding Loops, and using for and while to draw grids, squares and triangle shapes with characters.

### customFunctions (CodeAcademy)

Learning how to use functions in Kotlin, including lambdas and anonymous functions.

Writing custom functions to return minimum, maximum, average and checking if a value exists in a container.

### happyNewYear (CodeAcademy)

Recursion.

### calculator (CodeAcademy)

Kotlin calculator with user input, which includes 4 basic operations plus a custom powers function, instead of using Math library.

### whichday (Hyperskill)

Enter a day of the week then enter a number, and find out which day it will be in (n) days passed.

### Cinema (Hyperskill)

First, it prints cinema rows and seats in a square grid.

Then, the user inputs two positive integer numbes: the number of rows and the number of seats in each row. The ticket price is determined by the following rules:

If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the rest 5 rows.

Calculate the profit from the sold tickets depending on the number of seats and print the result as shown in the examples below. After that, your program should stop. Note that in this project, the number of rows and seats won't be greater than 9.

This results in a program which is complete cancer.
